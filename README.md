# A Jr Programmer Unity Project
This project has the basics regarding data persistance between scenes in a simple warehouse simulation.

## Some highlights
- Uses unity engine.
- This is part of the junior programmer training program.
- All business logic is made with C#.
- Data persistance is done between scenes in the same instance and some more between instances.
- Self driven forklifts!

## How to run it
- At the moment I have not left a build in the repo, will do soon.
- Requires latest Unity Editor LTS version to run it.
- Open with unity editor, build and run.
